**HikeCast** is my personal project that provides weather forecasts tailored for hiking enthusiasts. After the user sets the desired hiking location(s) and day (such as Monday, Tuesday, or a specific date, up to 7 days in advance), it retrieves weather data from the Open-Meteo API and uses Google Gemini AI to generate a detailed weather forecast and hiking tips. 

Besides weather forecasts and hiking tips, **HikeCast** also includes **Extreme Weather Alerts**. If extreme weather conditions are detected, users will receive a notification with the relevant details, ensuring they are well-prepared for their hiking adventures. This feature is turned on by default, and users can disable it if they prefer not to receive these alerts.
