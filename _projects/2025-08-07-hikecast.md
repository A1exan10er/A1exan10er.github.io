[**HikeCast**](https://github.com/A1exan10er/HikeCast) is my personal project that provides weather forecasts tailored for hiking enthusiasts. After the user sets the desired hiking **location(s)** and **day(s)** (such as Friday, Saturday, up to 7 days in advance), it retrieves weather data from the *Open-Meteo API* and uses *Google Gemini AI* to generate a detailed weather forecast and hiking tips.

Notification channels include *Telegram*, *Email*, and *WhatsApp* (WhatsApp is currently under development). Users can choose to receive notifications via these channels, and the service supports both with and without AI analysis, as shown below:

Besides weather forecasts and hiking tips, **HikeCast** also includes **Extreme Weather Alerts**. If extreme weather conditions are detected, users will receive a notification with the relevant details, ensuring they are well-prepared for their hiking adventures. This feature is turned on by default, and users can disable it if they prefer not to receive these alerts via the online dashboard settings. 

The service is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) and the configuration dashboard is accessible via the following link: [HikeCast Dashboard](https://hikecast.onrender.com/dashboard) (<em>Password required</em>). On the dashboard, users can edit their settings, including the location(s) and day(s) for which they want to receive weather forecasts.
